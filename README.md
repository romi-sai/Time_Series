# Project Overview

The objective of the time series project is to take in a given dataset, read it in and create two data representations of the dataset using PAA and SAX. Here, the goal is to reduce the number of samples needed to represent the given data. The second piece of this project is the classification, which is done through Euclidean Distance and Manhatten Distance. Here, our goal is to make valid conclusions on which one is better and if there are any noticeable trends.
